# WV Property Tax Reform Site

This is a simple static website built to support the grassroots campaign to eliminate property taxes on fully paid, owner-occupied homes in West Virginia.

## Purpose
The goal is to raise awareness, gather petition signatures, and provide legal and constitutional documents related to a proposed amendment to the West Virginia Constitution.

## Deployment
This site is designed for hosting via GitHub Pages:
1. Upload `index.html` to a GitHub repository.
2. Add this `README.md` to describe the project.
3. Go to Settings → Pages → Source → select "main" branch and `/root` folder.
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.
